# Fs-Cleaner
Fs cleaner is an application that has been designed to clean temporary files from users' PCs

How to use the program:
First run the fs.exe file preferably as an administrator, soon after starting it will appear 3 options horizontally and 3 vertically, the three in the vertical are what will clean the temp files equivalent to giving win+r and typing temp, %temp% and prefetch and deleting what is inside and the 3 in the horizontal is what leads to these respective folders because with the three in the vertical one you can clean all the files that are in the folder except other folders so this process has to be done by hand, but it's not common for folders within folders to be created so it's something you don't have to do  always, i recommend doing it every 1/2 weeks.

Note: Fs Cleaner may have problems if not started as administrator
